            Stay-at-Home Order Divorce Boom?

            Examining Data on Marital and Divorce Rates and the COVID-19 Pandemic.

        </h1>
        <center>By: Akila Forde</center>
        <div>
            <p> With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent government responses (business closures and stay-at-home orders), there was an expectation of a divorce boom. A combination of finanical stressors, grief, illness and child-care situations were excerbated during COVID-19 and <a href="https://legaltemplates.net/resources/personal-family/divorce-rates-covid-19/#divorces-increase-in-couples-with-children">reported</a> as major factors behind couples' decisions to separate.
                However, many of the articles positing this boom of divorces cited research from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-divorces-may-spike-after-covid-19-according-divorce-lawyer-2020-7" target="_blank">divorce lawyers</a>and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-divorces-may-spike-after-covid-19-according-divorce-lawyer-2020-7" target="_blank">legal documentation preparation websites</a>, predicting a wave of divorce filings in a post-COVID-19 world for the previously discussed reasons.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project seeks to examine whether such a boom actually occurred in 2020 or whether those expecting it to occur were looking at too-small samples of data to determine that COVID-19, and specifically stay-at-home orders, lead to an increase in divorces.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>
            Rather than a divorce boom, the US has seen a decrease in both Marriage and Divorce
            rates in the past 20 years
        </h2>
        <div class="flex-container">
            <div id="us_line" class="flex-item chart">
            </div>
            <div class="flex-item">
                <p>2020 saw a number of COVID-19 responses to curb the disease's spread, among which were state-wide and nationally-seen prohibitions of large gatherings, a trend which saw many marriages postponed or occurring on smaller scales. Thus, a fall in marriage rates in comparison to 2019, was to be expected. According to national marriage and divorce rate data acquired from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/marriage-divorce.htm" target="_blank">The CDC National Vital Statistics Service</a>, such a fall did occur. However, while the 2019-2020 decline was the sharpest in 20 years, it follows a precedent that was already established: declining U.S. marital rates. </p>
                <p>Despite this, were the responses to COVID-19 related to a increase in divorces, there should have been spike in the U.S. divorce rates between 2019 and 2020. 
                    The contrary happened instead, with divorce rates also following the 20-year trend of decline. It begs the question: what if there were less divorces overall, 
                    but with how varied responses to COVID-19 were, the aggregated national date is hiding actual divorce booms that happened by state? This led me to examine specifically the relationship with the type of stay-at-home order and divorce rates.</p>
            </div>

        </div>
        <h2>
            State-wide Stay-at-Home orders were 
            instituted at different times
        </h2>
        <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="flex-item">
                <p>As reports of COVID-19's spread worsened in early March 2019, the governments of many cities, counties, and states in the US made the decision to institute some variation of stay-at-home orders to stem the disease.
                    For the purposes of this project, I only consider state-level status, as whether a state's governor had instituted a state-wide order or not. Thus, states such as Utah, who had counties and cities which did
                    have stay-at-home orders, I denote as not having a State-wide order.
                </p>
                <p>The visualization to the right illustrates the stay-at-home order status, categorizing states based on whether they instituted
                    their order in a specific week. This data comes from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state_and_local_government_responses_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic/">Wikipedia</a>. States were split into categories </p>
                    Here, we can see a lot of variation as to the timing of the stay-at-home orders, with a high majority
                    of states who did undergo a stay-at-home order, did so within two weeks. There are a number of states, namely Utah, North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Wyoming, Oklahoma and Arkansas,
                    who by my definition did not have a stay-at-home order, and based on the divorce lawyer's hypothesis, should not see a change in divorce rates in comparison to the rest of the US. </div>
            <div>
                <div id="legend"></div>
                <div id="sah_map" class="flex-item chart"></div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h2>
            However, almost all States, regardless of Stay-at-home order status, saw a decrease in Divorce rates
        </h2>
        <div class="flex-container">
            <div id="div_chart" class="flex-item chart"></div>
            <div class="flex-item">
                <p>The figure to the left depicts the relationship between 2019 and 2020 state-level divorce rates, categorized by the timing of the state's stay-at-home order.
                    The 45-degree line represents a baseline where there was no change between the two years, for a state below this line, their 2020 divorce rate is lower than that of 2019 and vice versa.
                    State-level divorce rate data was acquired from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/marriage-divorce.htm" target="_blank">The CDC National Vital Statistics Service</a>, excluding California,
                    Hawaii, Indiana, Minnesota, and New Mexico. Based on the hypothesis that stay-at-home orders lead to a divorce boom, those states with no statewide order would be on the upper half of the 45-degree line,
                    which is not the case. However, on average, the states with no statewide order saw small decreases in their divorce rates than others, hinting at the possibility that the opposite is true,
                    that states without stay-at-home orders actually saw more divorces on average than their stay-at-home-order-enacted counterparts.
                </p>

        <div>                <p>
            Despite, illustrating the 2020 divorce boom did not happen, I will concede that it is possible a COVID-19 related divorce boom is in the works as there is a significant lag in when divorces are officially finalized
            and tallied. Combined with judicial delays because of shutdowns, we may see an increase in divorces in the coming 2021 and 2022 CDC state-level data. But as of now, there is no boom in 2020.

            <strong>Why are you interested in the topic?</strong>
            <p>
            I've always found the economics of partnerships an interesting study and with a lot of understandable concern as the socio-economic effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.578438/full">fertility decisions</a> and

            I decided this would be an interesting topic to study, since there was a large amount of concern for a divorce boom early on in the pandemic.

            <strong>What were other options for data and why did you choose this data set?</strong>       
            <p>
                Other options for data I could have used were the U.S. Census' American Community Survey for 2019 and 2020 as unlike the state-level divorce data from the CDC, 
                it would give estimates for states not included in the latter. However, the major concern with using the ACS data, was that Census put a warning not to compare
                their 2020 1-year estimates with previous years due to COVID-19-related quality concerns. That and it takes a while to prepare ACS data for analysis.
            </p>

            <strong>Is any data missing? Do you have concerns about data gaps?</strong>
            <p>The main missing data points are the divorce rates for California, Hawaii, Indiana, Minnesota, and New Mexico, which historically do not report their number of divorces due to state laws.
                These data gaps could've been filled. </p>

            <strong>How did you define your story? Any pivots that you made.</strong>
            <p>
                My story came about as an initial exploration in how marriage and divorce rates changed from pre-COVID19 to 2020, but as my visualizations came together,
                I realized my findings were contrary to the reports that were circulated. This led me to formalize my narrative of contradicting these predictions with what the data points actually showed.
            </p>

            <strong>Any ethical consideration in the story telling or disclosures you would like to make about choices you made while visualizing?</strong>
            <p>The main ethical consideration was that I was not attempting to make any claims that Stay-at-home orders caused an influx in divorces, and I understand that my 45-degree line may at first seem like
                a regression line, so I made sure to annotate what it represents as explicitly as possible.
            </p>

            <strong>Why did you choose the charts you chose? How do they help tell the story?</strong>
            <p>
                I chose the charts above for my story because they were an easily digestible way to present my story, that not only did a divorce boom not happen in 2020, but that stay-at-home orders did not correspond
                with any increases in divorce filings in the 2020. The US state map was a chart I really wanted to depict as it made the point that there was a lot of heterogeneity in government responses and the sunset colorscheme,
                which I maintain in the following scatter chart, grouped cohesively those states who did institute a state-wide stay-at-home order against those who did not.
            </p>

            <strong>Any coding challenges or takeaways?</strong>
            <p>
            Most of my challenges were related to using D3 to create the visualizations I needed to tell my story as well as debugging issue I found with the frankly lacking documentation related to certain charts.
            For example, rather than the scatter plot I used as my third graph, I initially wanted to attempt a slope graph using the same data, however I found it really difficult to properly visualize with online resources
            and figured that this scatter plot could visualize the same story, but I needed to annotate what relationship was being depicted very well.
            </p>
            <p>
            I pivoted to doing most of my data cleaning in Python before using them in my d3 charts, one challenge included acquiring a State-FIPS crosswalk to merge with my state data so I could leverage the mapping library we used in class.
            </p>
            <p>
            Another challenge I faced entailed with syncing the local HTML work I'd done with the Github pages, as sometimes the link to my project page gives an out-of-date article and visualizations.
