            Stay-at-Home Order Divorce Boom? Examining
            Data on Marital and Divorce Rates and the COVID-19 Pandemic.
        </h1>
        <div class="flex-container">
            <p> With the onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic and subsequent government responses (business closures and stay-at-home orders), there was an expectation of a divorce boom as a result, with increased financial stressors and sudden close-contact with spouses. 
                Divorce lawyers especially were <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-divorces-may-spike-after-covid-19-according-divorce-lawyer-2020-7" target="_blank">predicting</a> a wave of divorce filings in a post-COVID-19 world for previously discussed reasons.
                This project seeks to examine whether such a boom actually occurred in 2020, specifically using stay-at-home orders as a proxy for the pandemic.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>
            State-wide Stay-at-Home orders were 
            instituted at different times
        </h2>
        <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="flex-item">
                <p>As reports of COVID-19's spread worsened in early March 2019, the governments of many cities, counties, and states in the US made the decision to institute some variation of stay-at-home orders to stem the disease.
                    For the purposes of this project, I only consider state-level status, as whether a state's governor had instituted a state-wide order or not. Thus, states such as Utah, who had counties and cities which did
                    have stay-at-home orders, I denote as not having a State-wide order.
                </p>
                <p>The visualization to the right illustrates the stay-at-home order status, categorizing states based on whether they instituted
                    their order in a specific week. This data comes from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state_and_local_government_responses_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic/">Wikipedia</a>. States were split into categories </p>
                    Here, we can see a lot of variation as to the timing of the stay-at-home orders, with a high majority
                    of states who did undergo a stay-at-home order, did so within two weeks. There are a number of states, namely Utah, North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Wyoming, Oklahoma and Arkansas,
                    who by my definition did not have a stay-at-home order, and based on the divorce lawyer's hypothesis, should not see a change in divorce rates in comparison to the rest of the US. </div>
